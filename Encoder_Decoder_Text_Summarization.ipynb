The 30-year program has been kept on life support because the United States has not readied another vehicle to take its place. \\\"What is not acceptable is the fact that the most powerful nation in the world, the United States of America, finds itself in a situation that we didn't do the proper planning to have a vehicle in place to replace shuttle when it lands its last landing,\\\" Bolden said. NASA originally planned to retire the aging shuttle fleet last September, but mission delays have pushed that date. But once Endeavour, Atlantis and Discovery are permanently grounded, Russia's aging Soyuz capsules will ferry astronauts and cosmonauts to the space station and bring what supplies can fit in the smaller craft. And that will have to do, perhaps throughout this decade, until commercial cargo spacecraft are available. The last shuttle landing, according to the administrator, will not be in April when Endeavour is scheduled to fly. NASA says it wants one more mission to resupply the space station. That flight would be STS-135 this summer, using the Atlantis orbiter and designated with the acronym that stands for \\\"Space Transportation System.\\\" But whether NASA will have the money for the flight -- about a half a billion dollars -- is in question. \\\"We are budgeted for 135 and unless something disastrous happens, it's our intent to fly it,\\\" said Bolden, \\\"It's in the authorization bill signed by the president back in November, so for me it's the law and I'm excited about it because I need it, so we plan to fly 135.\\\" That would leave three flights before the program ends. STS-133 using Discovery sits on the launch pad ready to make its last trip into space Thursday. In April, STS-134 with Endeavour is schedule to fly. Commanding that mission is astronaut Mark Kelly. Kelly's wife, U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, was among 19 people shot in Arizona during a political event. Giffords is going through rehabilitation in Houston as she recovers from a gunshot wound to the head. During a news conference, Kelly said his wife would attend his launch. \\\"I pray that he is absolutely correct,\\\" Bolden said, \\\"because for all in the NASA family, who have been praying with him ever since that Saturday, and all of us who love her and him, It would be just tremendous, it would be tremendous for the nation. It would give everybody a big boost.\\\" But with those launches, the nation is seeing an end to its only means of putting humans in space. It is also seeing an end to a program that caught the public's attention nearly 30 years ago, with the launch on April 12, 1981, of the shuttle Columbia on the program's first mission. Bolden hopes that at least two commercial space companies will emerge to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. This will allow NASA to concentrate on building a new heavy-lift rocket capable of leaving lower Earth orbit. There had been concern whether the space agency would have enough money to develop this vehicle. Bolden said the money is there to build a vehicle that will evolve over time. \\\"When I say we are not going to do things the way we used to, we're not building the world's heaviest, biggest rocket right out of the chute. It's going to take us ... a decade or so to get to the point that we have the final vehicle that is going to take the first humans to Mars,\\\" said Bolden. The White House has said it wants humans on Mars by the mid-2030s. Right now, Bolden says his priority is flying these last three shuttle missions and bringing the astronauts home safely.\",\n          \"(CNN) -- Erroll Southers In the aftermath of the attempted bombing of Northwest Flight 253, it is likely the Senate will move to confirm the embattled nomination of Southers as head of the Transportation Security Administration when it returns from its winter recess. Objections to Southers' confirmation were first made by Republican Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina over the potential unionization of TSA employees. Southers is the Los Angeles International Airport's assistant chief for homeland security and intelligence. The airport's police department, which Southers has helped manage since early 2007, is the largest such operation in the country, with approximately 1,200 employees. Southers is also associate director at the Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism Events at the University of Southern California. The former FBI special agent served as a deputy director of homeland security for California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. CNN Political Ticker: DeMint defends blocking appointment . Miriam Siefer The attorney who will defend the 23-year-old Nigerian man accused of trying to blow up Northwest Flight 253 is no stranger to terrorism cases, according to The Detroit News. Miriam Siefer, chief federal defender with the Federal Defender Office in Detroit, Michigan, represented James Nichols when he was a suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing. His brother Terry Nichols was convicted for that act of domestic terrorism. Siefer is now the lead attorney for Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab, who is accused of hiding explosive materials sewn into his underwear that could have brought down the airplane. \\\"She's one of a handful of people who is universally respected and admired by people in the U.S. Attorney's Office,\\\" said Alan Gershel, the former head of criminal prosecutions in Detroit who now is a law professor at Cooley Law School in Auburn Hills, Michigan. Detroit News: Suspect's lawyer old hand at terror cases . Micah Fialka-Feldman A U.S. district judge has ruled that Oakland University in Rochester, Michigan, violated a federal law by refusing to allow Fialka-Feldman, a disabled student, to live in a campus dorm and now must make a room available for him. The Detroit News and NPR report that Fialka-Feldman has a mild cognitive impairment that hinders his ability to read and write. But the university said because he was in a special program and not a full-time student, he couldn't live on campus. It took him two buses and two hours to get to campus from his parents' home. The judge ruled that Oakland University had discriminated against Fialka-Feldman, who says he will hang a poster in his room with quotes from civil rights leaders. One says: \\\"A community that excludes one member is not a community at all.\\\" NPR: Intellectually disabled student wins dorm suit . Detroit News: Student wins housing fight . William Koch The Palm Beach, Florida, billionaire says that a 1787 Lafite Bordeaux with Thomas Jefferson's initials etched into the bottle is fake. \\\"I thought that I had a piece of history, a piece of America's most important history,\\\" Koch told the Los Angeles Times. So Koch sued the seller and has filed four other lawsuits. He says there are more to come. His goal is to clean up an industry where a single bottle can go for more than $100,000. In 1989, Koch purchased the Lafite and three other bottles of Bordeaux, also purported to be Jefferson's, for about $500,000. In the federal lawsuit he filed in New York against the wine supplier, Koch claims Jefferson's \\\"initials\\\" were etched into the bottle with modern-day power tools. Los Angeles Times: Wine collector sues over alleged fakery . Michael Landers This 15-year-old 10th-grader from Old Westbury, New York, is the youngest player to win the men's national singles championship in table tennis, or pingpong. In a New York Times profile, Landers says his training can last 30 hours each week. For 14 months, Goran Milanovic, a former Serbian discuss thrower, has been putting him through 90-minute workouts two or three times a week. NY Times: The ping-pong prodigy . What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.\",\n          \"Jose Mourinho, Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho are the star names confirmed for Deco's testimonial in July. The match in honour of the former Portuguese international will feature two of his teams, Porto's Class of '04 and Barcelona's Class of '06. Mourinho, currently in charge of Chelsea, will manage his Champions League-winning hosts at the Dragao Stadium. VIDEO Scroll to the bottom to watch some of Jose's funniest moment from the season . Remember me? Jose Mourinho will take charge of Porto for Deco's testimonial in July . Superstars: Lionel Messi and Ronaldinho will reunite for Barcelona's Class of '06, coached by Frank Rijkaard . Calls time: Deco called time on his glittering career earlier this year . After kick-starting a generation at the Catalan club, Dutch coach Frank Rijkaard will take charge of fellow European winners in 2006 Barca in the one-off game. Lionel Messi, Ronaldinho, Samuel Eto'o and Henrik Larsson will be on show according to Portuguese publication O Jogo, while Xavi and Andres Iniesta's participation depends on their fitness after the World Cup. Messi made his debut in a Barcelona shirt at the Dragao Stadium, and the match will give him a chance to link up with his idol once again. A teenage Argentine eventually oversaw Ronaldinho's departure to AC Milan with his sparkling displays, but owes a lot to the former No 10. 'Ronaldinho made everything much easier for me,' Messi told Barcelona's club website last year. 'He was also responsible for the change in Bar\\u00e7a. It was a bad time and the change that came about with his arrival was amazing. 'In the first year, he didn\\u2019t win anything but people fell in love with him. Then the trophies started coming and he made all those people happy. Bar\\u00e7a should always be grateful for everything he did.' European success: Barcelona won the Champions League in 2006, while Porto won in 2004 . Idol: Ronaldinho helped Messi settle upon his arrival in Spain as a teenager . Deco retired earlier this year after a glittering career. The Brazilian-born playmaker made his name at Porto, starring in that European success in 2004, then moving on to Barcelona. A switch to Chelsea saw him experience the Premier League, and he finished his career back at Fluminense in Brazil. Ricardo Carvaloho and Paolo Ferreira will star for Porto, and the game is set to take place on July 25 at 7.45pm. Playmaker: Deco made his name at Porto, and his testimonial will be on July 25 .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"highlights\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4995,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Hammond\\u00a0warns against complacency in the fight to disrupt terror plots .\\nForeign ministers from across the globe fly into London for talks .\\nThey will discuss plan to take on jihadis and prevent Paris-style attacks .\\nDavid Cameron promises the UK will do 'everything we can' to help Iraq .\",\n          \"Sheikh Ahmed bin Zayed Al Nahyan missing since plane crashed into lake in Morocco .\\nSheikh was managing director of the Dhabi Investment Authority .\\nHe also was a brother of the ruler of Abu Dhabi and Forbes' 27th richest person in world .\",\n          \"Online banking, microwaving and connecting to WiFi among most 'essential' skills .\\nKnitting, baking bread and writing letters no longer considered important .\\n2,000 adults polled in survey which listed knowing how to use Google as most needed skill .\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
